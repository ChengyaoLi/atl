    - read imu
    - set angles
    - set speed angles
- track tag with SBGC code at ultra-fast-speed
- yaw control
- estimate target velocity (global and relative)
- experiment with swathmore apriltag version

- define landing target parameters
- code up simple 2d simulator with pitch only (ignoring roll for planning)
- motion planning (with genetic algorithms or others)?
- contribution scope
