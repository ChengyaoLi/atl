# Plan

Landing a quadrotor on a moving platform.


## Milestones
- Literature review
- Make proposal
- Identify hardware (camera, extra sensors...)
- Identify potential algorithmic solutions
- Implement solutions in softwaree
- Implement solutions in hardware
- Calibration of sensors
- Computer vision ID landing zone
- Motion Planning to land
- Perform the above successfully in simulation
- Perform the above successfully in real life



## Potential Problems

- Gazebo may have poor wind simulations
- Quadrotor ground effects (GP calcuting the error term?)



## Questions

- What should we do with cameras?
- What needs to be done on the quadrotor?
- Would it be beneficial to outsource processing.
- Should we stream data?
