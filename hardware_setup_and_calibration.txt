DJI Hardware:

The manual for the N3 can be found here: http://dl.djicdn.com/downloads/N3/N3+User+manual.pdf

Summary:
    To calibrate compass, which should be done daily, flick the red switch on 
    the futaba controller, or the mode switch on the dji controller 3 times up 
    and down. If successful, the led will now be solid yellow. Pick up the quad, 
    and rotate it around 360 degrees until the light turns green. Pitch the quad 
    down degrees and rotate again. The light will now blink green if there is a
    gps lock and you are in position mode, or yellow if it is in attitude mode
    
    MODES: Red switch - all the way up is in position mode (slow blinking green)
                      - Down and midway, sport mode. Same as position but it
                      breaks the offboard control. Offboard controll only works
                      when the mode is in P. Be careful, if you in position mode, 
                      the offboard commands can arm the quad and make it take off
    
    Blinking: When flying, red blinking means low battery, the quad may land itself soon. 
    Green - slow = gps lock and position mode
    Green - fast = gps lock sport mode
    Yellow - slow? -- attitude mode, you have no gps so postion will not be held
